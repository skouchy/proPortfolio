This website is for a company called Horiseon which helps to manage client's SEO, online reputation, and social media marketing.

## Description
An online portfolio created as a hub to store, display, and build on as I continue to develop my Web Development experiences through applications. I have built this page utilizing a variety of CSS properties including: a hero-background image, positional attributes, navigation links, hover effects, both flex and grid displays, color gradients, and so much more. "Good things take time".
